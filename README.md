# SpringArm car physics

Following from [Wolfe's guide on GTPlanet](https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/gdsim-v0-4a-autocross-and-custom-setups.396400/).

This project isn't aimed at reproducing the realistic simulation of Wolfe's GDSim. The goal is to learn proper car handling, and my ultimate goal is to build some less realistic games based on my all time favorite racing games, like Carmageddon, Interstate 76, Destruction Derby 2, among others (and maybe even Motoracer, if I ever manage to wrap my head around bike physics). 

My primary motivation to follow the lead of a realistic simulator is that I'd like my games to have at the very least some proper and tweakable suspensions as well as consistent wheel collisions and a working gearbox and speedometer.
